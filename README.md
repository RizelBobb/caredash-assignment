## How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS,JavaScript, jQuery

This application is a quick, frontend project. The JavaScript I utilized is to have an array that switches through pictures every four seconds. I also added a feature that allows the user to click a menu item and it will scroll down to part of the page.  

## Optimizations

Because of time constraints, I did not get to do all that I wanted. If I did have more time, I would add form validations, I would add a server, and I would add React. I also wanted to create multiple views. After the doctor or user signs up and logs in, I wanted them to have an admin view to manage patients. 

## Lessons Learned: I learned an easier way to create a simple drop down menus.
